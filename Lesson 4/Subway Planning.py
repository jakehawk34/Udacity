# Write a function, subway, that takes lines as input (read more about
# the **lines notation in the instructor comments box below) and returns
# a dictionary of the form {station:{neighbor:line, ...}, ... } 
#
# For example, when calling subway(boston), one of the entries in the 
# resulting dictionary should be 'foresthills': {'backbay': 'orange'}. 
# This means that foresthills only has one neighbor ('backbay') and 
# that neighbor is on the orange line. Other stations have more neighbors:
# 'state', for example, has 4 neighbors.
#
# Once you've defined your subway function, you can define a ride and 
# longest_ride function. ride(here, there, system) takes as input 
# a starting station (here), a destination station (there), and a subway
# system and returns the shortest path.
#
# longest_ride(system) returns the longest possible ride in a given 
# subway system.
